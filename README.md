# Introduce
Imagine we are the member of a Retail/Telcos company and we wants to fuel its growth by Data-driven approach. This Series has 6 part research about 6 core problem of business:
- Part 1: [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/ToanToan110/CustomerSegmentation)
- Part 2: [Churn Prediction](https://github.com/ToanToan110/ChurnPrediction)
- Part 3: [Customer's Life Time Value](https://github.com/ToanToan110/CustomerLifeTimeValue)
- Part 4: [Sales Prediction](https://github.com/ToanToan110/SalesPrediction)
- Part 5: [Market ResponseModel](https://github.com/ToanToan110/MarketResponseModel)
- Part 6: [A/B Testing](https://github.com/ToanToan110/A-B-Testing)

# About this Project
Suppose we've run a series of promotional campaigns across multiple customer segments and noticed a difference in purchases.

Does this difference occur by chance? If not, what factors influence this difference?

=> We need to Perform A/B Testing to test the above hypothesis

# Prequisites
Dataset: This notebook use [Marketing Promotion Campaign Uplift Modelling Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davinwijaya/customer-retention) on Kaggle

# Aproach:
THe A/B testing process follow by this step:
- Define the problem
- Hypothesize
- Collect data and Create variations
- Rung the test
- Analyze result
- Iterate & optimize
